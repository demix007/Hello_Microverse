# Hello_Microverse
A repo created to complete the "Hello Microverse" project.

Hello Microverse Project
In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. My goal here was to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. As I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
